# Recovery-Risk---Final-Project-Financial-Enigeering-AY-2022-23
The aim of this project is to implement the MC simulation with at least 100,000 scenarios in the case of stochastic recovery rate and compute the corresponding VaR.
In order to do that we try to calibrate the distribution of the recovery rate to rating agency data, then we simulate the stochastic recovery rate through the Credit Capital Model and at
the end we valuate the Credit portfolio VaR by varying the different parameters of the model.

The project focuses on developing a comprehensive framework to assess, monitor these risks, ultimately enhancing the institutionâ€™s risk measure capabilities and overall financial stability.
